# Hackathon Machine Learning

## Overview

Welcome to the Hackathon project repository! This project was developed during Sagarmatha Hacks 2023, where we aimed to create a specific model that could potentially save lives. The project addresses the increasing mortality rate due to landslides and leverages an intelligent system that can predict and detect potential landslides using machine learning and geospatial data to provide a solution.

## Introduction

Hackathon Machine Learning is designed to facilitate machine learning exploration during hackathons. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced data scientist, this repository provides a set of tasks and a dataset to help you get started with building machine learning models for specific challenges.

## Tasks

The repository includes various machine learning tasks that cover a range of topics, such as classification, regression, and clustering. Each task is designed to be a standalone challenge that participants can work on during a hackathon. Feel free to choose the task that aligns with your interests or the hackathon theme.

## Dataset

The dataset for each task is provided within the respective task's directory. It includes the necessary data for training and evaluating machine learning models. Please refer to the documentation in each task directory for details on the dataset and the specific challenge.
